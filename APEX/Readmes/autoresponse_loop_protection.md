New feature built to handle infinte autoresponse loop: 

29 May 2025

Key Features Added:
1. Primary Loop Prevention
    def should_skip_autoresponse(recipient_email, sender_email):

This function prevents infinite loops by:

Skipping emails sent TO autoresponse accounts: If an email is sent directly to any account in EMAIL_ACCOUNTS, no autoresponse is triggered
Skipping emails FROM autoresponse accounts: If the sender is also in EMAIL_ACCOUNTS, no autoresponse is sent
Skipping system addresses: Handles noreply, no-reply, donotreply, mailer-daemon addresses

2. Enhanced Logging
The system now clearly logs when autoresponses are skipped and why:
    SKIPPING autoresponse: Email sent directly to autoresponse account: account@company.com

3. Robust Error Handling
The loop prevention logic is wrapped in try-catch blocks and won't break existing functionality.
How It Works:

Before sending any autoresponse, the system checks:

Is the original email sent TO an account that sends autoresponses?
Is the sender FROM an account that sends autoresponses?
Is it a system/noreply address?


If any condition is true, the autoresponse is skipped with clear logging
If conditions are false, normal autoresponse processing continues

Benefits:
Prevents infinite loops between autoresponse systems
Maintains existing functionality - no breaking changes
Clear logging for debugging and monitoring
Handles edge cases like system addresses and malformed emails
