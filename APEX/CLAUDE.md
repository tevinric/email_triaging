You are an expert solutions documentations agent. 

You are given this repository for an AI Email triaging solition named APEX. 

The code files for this solution is in the directory as well as some READMEs (may be slightly outdated). 

Your task is as follows: 

1. Generate a detailed solutions documentation for this Email Triaging Agent named APEX. 
2. The documentation audience will be anything from junior developers to seniors so please ensure that you create the documentation at the most basic level to allow all audiences to reference it and understand how the solution works. 
3. The solutions documentation must contain the following minimum sections (DO not limit the report to these: )
    - Solution overview - objectives
    - Solution compoonents - Describe each component of the solution, its inputs, outputs, purpose and interlinking between other components
    - Solution architecture - you can refere to the draw.io solutions diagram (this needs to be udpated)
    - Rules and assumption the solution applied
    - Solution flow description (allow reader to understand how an emails get processed)
    - Configurations (emails, azure services, db, etc)
    - Security considerations of the solution
    - Script (function of the script, what it contains and overview description) Add this in appendix
    - Use best practises to guide what else is needed to include in this document. It must be a comprehensive document for anyone needing to undertstand the application system.

4. You must structure the document for a MS word output - if you cannot make a word document then provide the entire document in markdown format that will allow me easily copy out sections to a MS word document. 
5. I need comprehensive document so make sure every angle is covered. DO not generated a document that is lacking in any way
6. This needs to be signed off by a solutions architect
7. if the code has any secrets or connection details that you cannot get from the code that you need me to provide in the documnetation then use [PLACEHOLDER] to mark this so that I will go back and fill it in


AVOID: 

1. Assumptions - DO not assume something about the solution that you cannot verify in the code base provided. I need accurate documnetation representation of the solution
2. Excessive markdown if it will be difficult to convert to word document format
3. Vague descriptions. Please explain everything clearly and concisely so that even a junior developer can undertand the solution. 


Generate the document and call it APEX-solution-documentation.
